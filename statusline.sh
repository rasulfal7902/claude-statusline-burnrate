# claude-statusline-burnrate — a Claude Code status line that does the
# weekly-limit math: real rate_limits data, today's share of the week,
# sustainable burn rate, sleep-aware pacing. Every meter color-coded.
#
# Renders:  🦄 Model effort │ 🎯 wk% today%t pace%/d trend │ 🧠 ctx% +add/-rem │ 🔥 5h% reset │ pet
#   🦄/🎭/🪶/🌸 = model mascot: Fable unicorn, Opus theater, Sonnet quill, Haiku blossom
#   │        = dim group separators: model │ weekly │ session │ 5h │ pet
#   🎯 wk%   = REAL weekly plan usage, straight from rate_limits.seven_day
#   today%t  = % of TODAY'S share of the weekly glide still available. The
#             ideal burn is a line from 0% at the weekly reset to 100% at the
#             next, drawn over AWAKE hours only: "days" run day-start to
#             day-start (default 2am), and the first SL_SLEEP_HOURS after
#             day-start count for nothing (18h awake = 1 day by default).
#             Today's share = the line's rise between day-start and the coming
#             one (14.3 on a full day); %t = (line@tonight - wk%) / share.
#             100 = the whole share is ahead of you, 0 = you are exactly ON
#             tonight's checkpoint (done for today), negative red = past it,
#             eating tomorrow. Capped at 100 when running behind the line.
#             The weekly % arrives as an INTEGER (1 tick = 7 %t points), so a
#             sub-tick interpolator (see its section) smooths %t between ticks
#             using this session's live cost; re-anchored at every real tick.
#   pace%/d  = sustainable burn in weekly points: (100-wk%) / awake-days-left
#             (clamped >=1 so with <1 day left pace = all that remains). By
#             construction it is tomorrow's envelope if you stop now; constant
#             while you spend exactly at it. Fresh week = 100/7 = 14.3. One
#             decimal below 10, where rounding error starts to matter.
#   trend    = wk% vs the AWAKE-time burn target (% of the week's awake hours
#             elapsed — calendar time would fall ~3.6 pts "behind" every night
#             while asleep). Goal = land at 100% exactly when the week resets.
#             ▲+N red = ahead (will cap early), ▼-N cyan = behind (leaving
#             sub unused), ✓ = ±3.
#   🧠       = how full THIS chat's context window is (resets on /clear or compact)
#   +add/-rem= lines changed this session (.cost), shown only once edits exist
#   🔥       = REAL 5-hour plan usage + time until its reset
#   pet      = animated cat; mood = the worst of the three meters above
#
# NOTE on animation cadence: this script only runs when Claude Code re-renders
# the status line (event-driven: often while streaming, never while idle).
# Nothing here can self-animate between renders — frames advance per render.
#
# WHY read rate_limits directly: it is the true server-side plan usage. An
# earlier version estimated 5h burn with the `ccusage` npm tool against a p90
# "heavy-block" budget — a proxy that needed node + a background cache and read
# low because of outlier blocks. Once Claude Code exposed rate_limits (v2.1.x)
# that whole machinery was deleted: this script is now pure jq + awk, zero
# external deps beyond jq. Per-field gotchas are commented at their code sites.
